# Classifying-the-Graduation-Time-Status-of-UNJ-Students

## Description

I compared the classification algorithms AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree using a case study of whether or not a student of UNJ will graduate on time using Python and Ms. Excel (for some visualization). This is a project for my bachelor's degree.

## Atributte Information
The response variable in this study is a binary variable, graduate on time or not (Yes = 1, No = 0), and the predictor variables are GPA and Credit.
