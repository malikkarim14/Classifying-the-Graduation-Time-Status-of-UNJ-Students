# Predicting-the-On-Time-Graduation-Status-of-UNJ-Students

## Description

I compared the classification algorithms AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree using a case study of whether or not a student will graduate on time using Python and Ms. Excel (for some visualization). This is a project for my bachelor's degree.

## Source Code
